# LCRchumIPM

This is the development site for an integrated population model (IPM) for chum salmon in the Lower Columbia River ESU. It is a collaborative project between the [Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife](https://wdfw.wa.gov/), [Mount Hood Environmental](https://mthoodenvironmental.com/), the [US Geological Survey Washington Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://depts.washington.edu/wacfwru/) and the [Northwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center). A vignette on a recent version of the model can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ebuhle/LCRchumIPM/blob/master/analysis/R/LCRchumIPM_analysis.html).
