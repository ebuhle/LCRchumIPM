# LCRchumIPM

This is the development site for an integrated population model (IPM) for chum salmon in the Lower Columbia River ESU. It is a collaborative project between the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife ([WDFW](https://wdfw.wa.gov/)), [Mount Hood Environmental](), the [US Geological Survey Washington Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://depts.washington.edu/wacfwru/).  and the National Marine Fisheries Service ([NMFS](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/)). A vignette on a recent version of the model can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ebuhle/LCRchumIPM/blob/master/analysis/R/LCRchumIPM_analysis.html).
